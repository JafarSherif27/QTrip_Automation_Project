# QTrip QA – April 2025

QTrip is a travel website and the subject of this QA Automation Project. The objective was to design, automate, and validate end-to-end test cases using industry-standard tools and best practices.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains automated test cases for the QTrip application. These tests are written in Java using the Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and follow the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. 

## ✅ Key Features

- 🚀 Designed and automated **4 test cases and Unit Tests** for QTrip UI flow.
- 🧩 **Page Object Model (POM)** implemented using **PageFactory** for modular and maintainable test structure.
- 🔁 Utilized **Apache POI** for reading **dynamic test data** from Excel sheets.
- 📦 Created a **TestNG project** for structured test execution and reporting.
- 🧠 Applied **Singleton design pattern** for WebDriver initialization to optimize resource usage.
- 📊 Generated **custom test reports** using **Extent Reports**.
